        <h2>The story</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,</p> <blockquote class="villagers"><i>“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</i></blockquote> <p>The farmer said,</p> <blockquote class="farmer"><i><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></i></blockquote> <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,</p> <blockquote class="villagers"><i>“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</i></blockquote> <p>The farmer again said,</p> <blockquote class="farmer"><i><em>“Maybe.”</em></i></blockquote>
            <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,</p> <blockquote class="villagers"><i>“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</i></blockquote> <p>and the farmer responded,</p> <blockquote class="farmer"><i><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></i></blockquote> <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,</p> <blockquote class="villagers"><i>“Isn’t that great!”</i></blockquote> <p>Again, he said,</p> <blockquote class="farmer"><i><em>“Maybe.”</em></i></blockquote>
            <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is 
               <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span>  — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">bad</span>  are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
